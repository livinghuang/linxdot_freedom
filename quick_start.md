## Accessing LD1002 via SSH and Editing global_conf.json <a name="accessing-ld1002-via-ssh"></a>

To configure the LD1002 Lorawan Gateway further, you can SSH into the device and edit the `global_conf.json` file. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window on your computer.

2. Use the SSH command to connect to the LD1002:
   ```bash
   ssh root@<LD1002_IP_Address>
   ```
   Replace `<LD1002_IP_Address>` with the actual IP address of your LD1002. When prompted, enter the password `linxdot`.

3. Once logged in, navigate to the directory containing the `global_conf.json` file:
   ```bash
   cd /etc/lora/
   ```

4. Use the `vi` editor to open the `global_conf.json` file specific to your region and radio module. For example, for AS923_1 region and SX1250 radio module, use:
   ```bash
   vi global_conf.json.sx1250.AS923_1
   ```

5. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the file, and press `i` to enter insert mode.

6. Make the necessary modifications to the configuration parameters according to your requirements.

7. Once you have finished editing, press `Esc` to exit insert mode.

8. To save your changes and exit the vi editor, type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

9. Restart the Lorawan Gateway service to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart lorawan-gateway
   ```

Now, your LD1002 Lorawan Gateway is configured with the updated settings specified in the `global_conf.json` file.
These instructions provide a step-by-step guide for customers to SSH into the LD1002, edit the `global_conf.json` file using the vi editor, and restart the Lorawan Gateway service to apply the changes.
